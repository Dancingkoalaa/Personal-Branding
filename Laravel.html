    <a>This was my first ever laravel project. It was a character archive where people are able to add characters to the list.
        These all had their own atributes and were also shown by maker. Other users were able to add the characters to their favorites list.
        To do so, a user has to log in. But to just see the characters there was no requirement to log in!
